title: Using custom runners with Flash Builder 4's built-in FlexUnit4 support
created: 1268123004

<p>Recently, I've been trying to get <a href="http://bitbucket.org/loomis/mockito-flex/wiki/Home">mockito-flex</a> to play nice with Flash Builder 4's built-in FlexUnit4 support. For its part, mockito requires the use of a custom test runner class, MockitoClassRunner, to run any test case containing mockito dependencies, declared using FlexUnit4's "RunWith" metadata tag:</p><blockquote>{syntaxhighlighter brush: as3;fontsize: 100; first-line: 1; }[RunWith("org.mockito.integrations.flexunit4.MockitoClassRunner")]
public class MockitoTestCase{/syntaxhighlighter}</blockquote><p>One caveat of custom runners is that they require being linked into the project:</p><blockquote><p><strong><span class="mw-headline">RunWith("fullyQualifiedName")</span></strong><br>-- Used to identify a specific runner that should be used for this class. Common uses include specifying a class to use the Suite runner or Theory runner. The class specified must be linked into the project and must implement the IRunner interface.</p><p><sup>(from: http://docs.flexunit.org/index.php?title=Metadata)</sup></p></blockquote><p>Without proper linkage FlexUnit4 will not be able to find the runner, throwing a runtime error such as the following:</p><blockquote><p>Error: Custom runner class org.mockito.integrations.flexunit4.MockitoClassRunner should be linked into project and implement IRunner. Further it needs to have a constructor which either just accepts the class, or the class and a builder.</p></blockquote><p>A simple way of linking the runner is to include a variable typed to the custom runner's class inside of the class that initiates the test run. <!--break-->When using FB4's built-in FlexUnit4 support, the class running the tests is FlexUnitApplication, auto-generated by FB4 after tests have been selected in the "Run FlexUnit Tests" dialog.</p>
<blockquote>{syntaxhighlighter brush: as3;fontsize: 100; first-line: 1; }public class FlexUnitApplication extends Sprite
{
    private var mockitoRunner:MockitoClassRunner;      
     
    public function FlexUnitApplication()        
    {            
        ...{/syntaxhighlighter}</blockquote><p>
Though the auto-generation of FlexUnitApplication is very convenient feature, automating the otherwise tedious, manual labor of supplying test cases to the runner's "run()" method, its re-generated from scratch each time the test case selection changes, discarding any custom alterations, including the linkage variable. Manually adding the variable each time FlexUnitApplication is regenerated is a tedious and error-prone process in itself, but one that can thankfully be avoided using the following technique.</p><p>In FB4's "Preferences" dialog, the one and only FlexUnit specific option lends itself very well to this situation. Here you can declare a custom application for FlexUnit4 to run instead of the one that's auto-generated. Do note that using a custom application class does not stop the auto-generation of FlexUnitApplication, a fact that can be utilized to add a linkage variable that won't get thrown away each time FlexUnitApplication is regenerated.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.patrickmowrer.com/sites/patrickmowrer.com/files/images/flexunit_prefs.png" alt="" width="500" height="268"></p><p>After a custom application name has been defined, the corresponding class needs to be created somewhere within the project hierarchy. This class should inherit from FlexUnitApplication and contain the linkage variable:</p><blockquote>{syntaxhighlighter brush: as3;fontsize: 100; first-line: 1; }import org.mockito.integrations.flexunit4.MockitoClassRunner;

public class CustomFlexUnitApplication extends FlexUnitApplication
{      
    private var mockitoRunner:MockitoClassRunner;   
    
    public function CustomFlexUnitApplication()      
    {            
        super();      
    }       
}{/syntaxhighlighter}</blockquote><p>Additionally, the custom application class needs to be made one of the runnable application files within the project (else FB4 will let you know so):</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.patrickmowrer.com/sites/patrickmowrer.com/files/images/customflexunitapp_runnable.png" alt="" width="500" height="223"></p><p>Now, when launching the "FlexUnit Tests" application via FB4, CustomFlexUnitApplication will be launched instead of FlexUnitApplication. As the former inherits from the latter, all of the auto-generated convenience is still available while keeping the linkage variable necessary to run the MockitoClassRunner.</p>
